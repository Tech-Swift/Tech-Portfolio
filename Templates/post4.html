        <h2>Photography Tips for Developers</h2>

        <h3>Technical Fundamentals</h3>
    
        <p><strong>Exposure triangle as a function:</strong> Think of aperture (f-stop), shutter speed, and ISO as parameters in a function where changing one affects the others. F/2.8 lets in more light but reduces depth of field; 1/1000 shutter speed freezes motion but requires more light.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Histograms as data visualization:</strong> Learn to "debug" your exposure by reading these graphs — a left-skewed histogram indicates underexposure, right-skewed means overexposure.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Manual mode mastery:</strong> Just as custom code offers more control than libraries, manual mode gives precise control over your creative output.</p>
    
        <h3>Composition Principles</h3>
    
        <p><strong>Rule of Thirds as a layout grid:</strong> Position key elements at grid intersection points (many cameras offer overlay guidelines).</p>
    
        <p><strong>Leading lines as user flow:</strong> Guide the viewer's eye through the image using natural paths, just as you'd design intuitive UI navigation.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Negative space as whitespace:</strong> Empty areas create balance and emphasis, similar to clean code and well-designed interfaces.</p>
    
        <h3>Equipment Strategy</h3>
    
        <p><strong>Modular approach:</strong> Build your kit incrementally — start with a versatile 35mm or 50mm prime lens before investing in specialized gear.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Version control for gear:</strong> Test equipment through rentals before purchasing, much like testing libraries before implementation.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Portable solutions:</strong> Consider computational photography with newer smartphones for situations where carrying a DSLR isn't practical.</p>
    
        <h3>Post-Processing Workflow</h3>
    
        <p><strong>Non-destructive editing:</strong> Always preserve your RAW files as "source code" and make changes in layers that can be modified later.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Automate repetitive tasks:</strong> Create presets for common adjustments like you would create functions for repeated code.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Batch processing:</strong> Learn scripting in tools like Lightroom to process multiple images with consistent adjustments.</p>
    
        <h3>Developer-Specific Projects</h3>
    
        <p><strong>API visualization photography:</strong> Create abstract representations of your architecture or data flow.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Time-lapse coding sessions:</strong> Document your development process through automated capture.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Macro exploration:</strong> Photograph circuit boards, chips, and hardware with close-up techniques to reveal hidden patterns and textures.</p>
    
        <h3>Integration Tips</h3>
    
        <p><strong>Version control your photos:</strong> Apply Git-like principles to organize your photography library.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Metadata management:</strong> Develop a consistent tagging system to make images searchable and organized.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Build a photography portfolio site:</strong> Create your own custom platform to showcase your work while practicing web development skills.</p>
    
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    
        <p>Photography and development both reward systematic thinking, attention to detail, and continuous iteration. Your debugging mentality will help you identify what works and doesn't work in your images, allowing you to refine your technique with each shot.</p>
